- ✅ Created initial commit with all enhancements
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/LakshmiSravya123/Harmony.git
- ✅ Set up main branch as default

## Next Steps for Running the App

1. **Install Flutter** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # Visit https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
   ```

2. **Create `.env` file**:
   ```
   OPEN_AI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Run setup script**:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Technical Debt Addressed

- ✅ Added proper error handling throughout
- ✅ Improved null safety
- ✅ Added resource cleanup
- ✅ Enhanced code documentation
- ✅ Consistent code style
- ✅ Better separation of concerns

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test camera permissions on physical device
2. Test OpenAI API integration with valid key
3. Test Firebase initialization (if using Firebase features)
4. Test health data integration on iOS/Android
5. Test database operations (SQLite)
6. Test offline functionality

## Known Limitations

1. Flutter SDK required to run (not installed on current system)
2. Firebase configuration files (google-services.json, GoogleService-Info.plist) need to be added for full Firebase support
3. Health data integration requires platform-specific permissions setup
4. AR features commented out (requires additional setup)

## Performance Optimizations

- Efficient state management with Provider
- Lazy loading of camera resources
- Proper async/await usage
- Resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
