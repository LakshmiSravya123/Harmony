## ❌ Critical Errors Found

### 1. **Incorrect Project Structure** (CRITICAL)
**Error:** All Dart code files were in the wrong location
- `providers/` folder was at root level instead of inside `lib/`
- `screens/` folder was at root level instead of inside `lib/`

**Impact:** This would cause the Flutter app to fail to compile completely.

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
mv providers lib/
mv screens lib/
```

**Before:**
```
harmony/
├── lib/
│   ├── env/
│   └── main.dart
├── providers/          ❌ Wrong location
└── screens/            ❌ Wrong location
```

**After:**
```
harmony/
└── lib/
    ├── env/
    ├── providers/      ✅ Correct location
    ├── screens/        ✅ Correct location
    └── main.dart
```

### 2. **Incorrect Import Paths in main.dart**
**Error:** Import paths didn't use package notation

**Lines affected:**
- Line 5: `import 'env/env.dart';`
- Line 6: `import 'providers/journal_provider.dart';`
- Line 7: `import 'screens/home_screen.dart';`

**Fix Applied:**
```dart
// Before
import 'env/env.dart';
import 'providers/journal_provider.dart';
import 'screens/home_screen.dart';

// After
import 'package:spiritual_harmony_journal/env/env.dart';
import 'package:spiritual_harmony_journal/providers/journal_provider.dart';
import 'package:spiritual_harmony_journal/screens/home_screen.dart';
```

---

### 3. **Unused Import in journal_provider.dart**
**Error:** `dart:io` was imported but never used

**Fix Applied:**
```dart
// Removed line 2
import 'dart:io';
```

---

## ⚠️ Missing Files (Still Need Attention)

### 1. **Missing env.g.dart**
**Status:** Not generated yet (gitignored, needs to be created)

**Required Action:**
```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

**Why it's missing:** This file is auto-generated and gitignored (as it should be). Each developer needs to generate it locally.

---

### 2. **Missing android/ and ios/ directories**
**Status:** Platform folders don't exist

**Impact:** Cannot run on Android or iOS devices/emulators

**Required Action:**
```bash
flutter create --platforms=android,ios .
```

**Note:** This needs to be run after Flutter is installed.

---

### 3. **Missing Firebase Configuration Files**
**Status:** Firebase is initialized in code but config files are missing

**Missing files:**
- `android/app/google-services.json` (for Android)
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS)

**Impact:** Firebase initialization will fail (currently caught by try-catch)

**Required Action:**
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Download configuration files
3. Place them in the correct locations
